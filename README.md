## Hello!

I'm Hazal, a Data Analyst from New York City.	

I bring a curious mind and a diverse background with a focus on analytics to the table and I see data analytics as an optimal platform for combining my analytical and creative abilities.

I am well-versed in Excel and Tableau and have a keen interest in Python. I am also actively working to take my SQL skills to the next level.
